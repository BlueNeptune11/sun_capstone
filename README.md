# Solar Variability Capstone Project

- __Authors__: Nathan Besch, Laura Hayes, Caitr√≠ona M. Jackman

This is the codebase for my capstone project on the Solar Wind using in-situ data from Nasa Parker Space Probe and ESA Solar Orbiter (SO).

## Installation Steps (recommended)

__Requirements__: git, Python 3.13.7, environment management system for Python (conda, pyenv...)

Clone the repository in your desired directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/BlueNeptune11/sun_capstone.git
```
We recommend creating a new Python 3.13.7 environment using your preferred tool. Go to the root of the repo and install the required project packages in your newly created environment:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
